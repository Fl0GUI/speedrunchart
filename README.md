# speedrunchart
This chart shows all the (latest) speedruns on a specific category from a game using the speedrun.com API.

It shows you:
- progression of runners
- progression of WR 
- full history of a runner's pb
- if a runners bopped another runner
- the leaderboard (although not very readable)
- how active the category and runners are

# TODO
- [ ] game and variables as arguments (almost)
- [ ] users as arguments
- [x] format time in the window you get when hovering over a dot
- [x] scrolling and panning
- [ ] more agressive log scaling
- [ ] only one dot selected when hovering over one
- [ ] better ticks
- [ ] toggle for expanding the line to the current day
- [ ] default selection of runners
- [ ] do something about white lines being invisible against the white background
- [ ] overall chart scaling on a page
- [ ] fix order in tooltip
- [ ] somehow make it not a total mess when a lot of runners are active. example:
